# SuperPlanets
WebGL game made in unity
A skill-based game inspired by the web game 'Curve Fever', with gameplay centered around a sphere, making it a game of incomplete information.
The game's name comes from the idea of adding new gameplay modes that also take place on a so-called 'planet',
which has the potential to create a kind of group of games accessible through a single application.

At the moment, it is possible to add up to 20 bots in the game settings. The controls are the A and D buttons.
